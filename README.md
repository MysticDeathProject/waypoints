# waypoints for sypb and ebot and yapb
Due to the fact that HsK_CNN has abandoned the updates of sypb, it was decided to just create a separate topic with ewp and pwf and formats of waypoints for different bots, be it sypb or ebot or yapb bots, but it's better to download the whole archive.

## Goals of the project
<ul>
<li>Fix waypoints for real time</li>
<li>CPU performance optimization</li>
<li>Small helping for any projects</li>
  <li>Make the best waypoints for zombie mod ONLY</li>
</ul>
