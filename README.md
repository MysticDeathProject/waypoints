# waypoints for sypb and ebot and yapb
Due to the fact that HsK_CNN has abandoned the updates of wavepoints, it was decided to just create a separate topic with ewp and pwf and formats of wavepoints for different bots, be it sypb or ebot or yapb bots, but it's better to download the whole archive.


## Goals of the project
<ul>
<li>Fix waypoints for real time</li>
<li>CPU performance optimization</li>
<li>Small helping for any projects</li>
</ul>

##### Download
Better download all archive
